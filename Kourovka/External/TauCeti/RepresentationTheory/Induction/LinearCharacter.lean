# The dimension of a representation induced from a linear character

Induction from a subgroup of finite index multiplies the dimension by the index
(`TauCeti.finrank_indFDRep`), and the representation carrying a linear character is a line
(`FDRep.finrank_ofLinearCharacter`). Putting the two together, what a linear character of `N`
induces to has dimension exactly `N.index`, whatever the group and whatever the character: this
is the dimension count every worked example of induction from a linear character opens with.

Nothing here is about irreducibility, so nothing here depends on the Mackey theory that those
examples go on to use.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.finrank_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter`: what a linear character induces to has the
  dimension of the index of the subgroup.
