# Burnside's lemma on a product of two `G`-sets

A point of a product `G`-set `X × Y` is fixed by `g` exactly when both of its components are, so
Mathlib's Burnside lemma `MulAction.sum_card_fixedBy_eq_card_orbits_mul_card_group`, applied to
`X × Y`, reads

`∑ g : G, |X^g| * |Y^g| = |(X × Y) / G| * |G|`.

This is the shape in which Burnside's lemma computes the pairing of two permutation characters.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.fixedBy_prod`: the fixed points of `g` on `X × Y` are the product of its fixed points
  on `X` and on `Y`.
* `TauCeti.card_fixedBy_prod`: the corresponding count.
* `TauCeti.sum_card_fixedBy_mul_card_fixedBy_eq_card_orbits_mul_card_group`: Burnside's lemma
  on `X × Y`.
* `TauCeti.isPretransitive_prod_left`: a product with a one-point `G`-set stays pretransitive,
  and `TauCeti.card_orbitQuotient_eq_one` then counts its orbits, which is the value Burnside's
  lemma takes on such a product.

## Implementation notes

Everything is phrased with `Nat.card`; Mathlib's Burnside lemma is stated with `Fintype.card` and
carries `Fintype` instances for each fixed-point set, which are supplied here from `Finite X` and
`Finite Y` rather than assumed.
