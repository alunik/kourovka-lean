# Cardinality of stabilisers under the two standard transports

A count defined through a point stabiliser is useful only alongside the rules for moving it.
Two such rules are recorded here, both consequences of Mathlib machinery rather than new
mathematics, and both stated for `Nat.card` because that is the form a numerical invariant of
an orbit is wanted in. The first of them is what lets the count descend to the orbit space, so
that descent is recorded here as well, as the definition `cardStabilizerOnOrbit`.

*Along an orbit* the stabiliser order does not change: related points have conjugate
stabilisers, by `MulAction.stabilizerEquivStabilizerOfOrbitRel`.

*Along a surjection* it divides: if `f : G →* H` is onto and the two actions agree at the point
in question, then the `G`-order of that point's stabiliser is `Nat.card f.ker` times its
`H`-order. Taking `f` to be a quotient map gives the projective case, where the divisor is the
subgroup quotiented out.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.card_stabilizer_of_orbitRel`: the stabiliser order is an invariant of the orbit,
  with `TauCeti.card_stabilizer_smul` the translate-presented corollary.
* `TauCeti.cardStabilizerOnOrbit`: that order as a function on the orbit space, with
  `TauCeti.cardStabilizerOnOrbit_mk` its evaluation lemma.
* `TauCeti.card_stabilizer_eq_card_ker_mul_card_stabilizer`: the stabiliser order divides by
  `Nat.card f.ker` along a surjection `f`, with
  `TauCeti.card_stabilizer_eq_card_subgroup_mul_card_stabilizer_quotient` the quotient-map
  corollary and
  `TauCeti.card_stabilizer_eq_card_subgroupOf_mul_card_stabilizer_map` its relative form, for a
  subgroup mapped into the quotient.
* `TauCeti.card_stabilizer_subgroupOf`: the degenerate case of that surjection, where the map is
  the isomorphism `𝒢.subgroupOf ℋ ≃* 𝒢` and the order is unchanged.
* `TauCeti.card_stabilizer_coset_eq_card_stabilizer_inv_smul`: the class of `g` in `G ⧸ H` has,
  inside `stabilizer G p`, a stabiliser of the same order as `g⁻¹ • p` has inside `H` —
  conjugation by `g` is the bijection.

/-- **The order of a stabiliser is constant along an orbit**: points related by the orbit
relation have conjugate stabilisers, hence stabilisers of equal cardinality.

This is what lets a count defined through a point stabiliser — the order `e_P` of an elliptic
point of a Fuchsian group, say — be read as an invariant of the orbit. It holds with no
finiteness hypothesis: for an infinite stabiliser both sides are `0`, by `Nat.card`'s
convention. -/
theorem card_stabilizer_of_orbitRel {a b : α} (h : MulAction.orbitRel G α a b) :
    Nat.card (MulAction.stabilizer G a) = Nat.card (MulAction.stabilizer G b) :=
  Nat.card_congr (MulAction.stabilizerEquivStabilizerOfOrbitRel h).toEquiv

/-- The orbit invariance of `card_stabilizer_of_orbitRel` in the form wanted when the second
point is presented as a translate of the first.

Not `@[simp]`: whether `Nat.card (MulAction.stabilizer G (g • a))` is in normal form depends on
the action, since a `simp` lemma for the particular `•` can rewrite inside it. -/
theorem card_stabilizer_smul (g : G) (a : α) :
    Nat.card (MulAction.stabilizer G (g • a)) = Nat.card (MulAction.stabilizer G a) :=
  card_stabilizer_of_orbitRel (MulAction.orbitRel_apply.mpr (MulAction.mem_orbit a g))

/-- **The stabiliser order as a function on the orbit space.** `card_stabilizer_of_orbitRel`
says the order is constant along an orbit, so it descends to `MulAction.orbitRel.Quotient G α`,
which is the form wanted when the count is summed over orbits rather than over points.

Note this counts the stabiliser in `G` itself. When the action is not faithful the kernel sits
inside every stabiliser and inflates each value by `Nat.card` of it — so for a group acting
through a quotient, this is the order upstairs, not the order of the group that acts
effectively. `card_stabilizer_eq_card_subgroup_mul_card_stabilizer_quotient` is the conversion
between the two. -/

/-- **A surjection of acting groups divides stabiliser orders by its kernel**: if `f : G →* H`
is surjective and the `H`-action agrees with the `G`-action along `f` *at the point `a`*, then
the stabiliser of `a` in `G` is `Nat.card f.ker` times its stabiliser in `H`.

Compatibility is asked for only at `a`, not globally, since that is all the count needs; a
caller holding the global statement supplies `fun g ↦ h g a`. -/

/-- **Passing to a quotient group divides stabiliser orders by the subgroup**: the case of
`card_stabilizer_eq_card_ker_mul_card_stabilizer` for the quotient map, whose kernel is `N`.

This is the step from a matrix-group stabiliser order to the projective one. The divisor is
`Nat.card N` in general; for `SL(2, ℤ) ↠ PSL(2, ℤ)` that is the centre `±1`, so there the
elliptic orders `e_P` are the matrix counts halved. For a Fuchsian `Γ` with `-I ∉ Γ` the two
counts coincide. -/

/-- **The relative form: a subgroup, and its image in the quotient.** For `Γ ≤ G`, the stabiliser
of `a` in `Γ` is `Nat.card (N.subgroupOf Γ)` — the part of `N` that `Γ` actually contains — times
the stabiliser of `a` in the image of `Γ` in `G ⧸ N`.

`card_stabilizer_eq_card_subgroup_mul_card_stabilizer_quotient` is the case `Γ = ⊤`, where the
divisor is all of `N`. The relative statement is what a Fuchsian group needs, where `Γ` is a
subgroup of `SL(2, ℤ)` and `N` the centre: there the divisor measures how much of `±I` lies in
`Γ`, and the projective elliptic order `e_P` is the matrix stabiliser order divided by it.
Evaluating that divisor is a fact about the particular `Γ` and is not proved here. -/

/-- **Stabiliser orders agree across `subgroupOf`.** For `𝒢 ≤ ℋ`, a point has the same stabiliser
order in `𝒢.subgroupOf ℋ` as in `𝒢` itself.

This is the transport wanted whenever an orbit count produced inside `ℋ` has to be read against
the `𝒢`-orbit it weights, since `cardStabilizerOnOrbit` reads the order in `𝒢`. Mathlib's
`stabilizerEquivStabilizer` transports between two *points* of one group, not between two groups
at one point, so it does not apply here. -/
