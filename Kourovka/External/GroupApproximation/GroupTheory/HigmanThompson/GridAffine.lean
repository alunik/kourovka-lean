# Grid-affine bijections of `ℚ`

The finitely presented simple group of `non_mf_groups_exist.tex`, Section 5, is a
Hyde–Lodha group (Fournier-Facio's §2 names "a Burger–Mozes or Hyde–Lodha group").
Hyde and Lodha build it from piecewise linear homeomorphisms of the line whose
breakpoints lie in `ℤ[1/m]` and whose slopes lie in a multiplicative group `Ω`.
This module sets up the piecewise linear layer.

A map is recorded here through the rationals, where every map of the relevant
class sends `ℚ` to `ℚ` and all arithmetic is exact, and "finitely many breakpoints
in each bounded interval, all in `ℤ[1/m]`" is recorded as **uniform grid
affinity**: there is a level `N` such that `f` is affine on every interval
`[k/m^N, (k+1)/m^N]`, and a bound `B` such that every slope and every value at a
level-`N` grid point lies in `m^{-B} ℤ`.

The one real lemma is `GridAffine.comp`: composing with a grid-affine strictly
increasing bijection whose inverse is grid-affine gives a grid-affine map, at an
explicit finer level.  `PLGroup m Ω` is the resulting subgroup of `Equiv.Perm ℚ`.
