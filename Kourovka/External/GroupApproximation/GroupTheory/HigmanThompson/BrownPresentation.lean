# Brown's finite presentation of `F_{m+2,∞}`

The group `BrownGroup m` is presented on `x_0, …, x_{m+1}` by the finitely many relators
`X_i X_j X_i⁻¹ X_{j+m+1}⁻¹` with `1 ≤ i ≤ m + 1` and `i < j ≤ i + m + 2`, where the words
`X_k` for `k ≥ m + 2` are defined by `X_k = x_0 X_{k-m-1} x_0⁻¹`.

* `brownX_rel`: every relation `X_i X_j X_i⁻¹ = X_{j+m+1}`, `i < j`, follows (strong induction
  on `j - i`; the long relations reduce to shorter ones through `X_{i+1}`, and relations at
  large `i` are `x_0`-conjugates of relations at smaller `i`).
* `brownEval_injective`: the evaluation `x_k ↦ xg m k` into `Equiv.Perm ℚ` is injective.
  Every element is `p⁻¹ · q` with `p, q` positive (`exists_form`), positive words sort by
  insertion (`brownPos_brownSort`), and a sorted positive word is read off its evaluation:
  its first letter `a` is where the map first moves points (`x_k` fixes `(-∞, k]` and
  moves `(a, a+1]` up), so two sorted words with equal evaluations agree letter by letter
  (`sorted_eq_of_eval_eq`).
* `brownF_isFinitelyPresented`: the image group is finitely presented.
